For purposes of this Agreement, 'Net Option Share' means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, 'Merger Consideration Value' means an amount in cash equal to (I) the Cash Consideration plus (II) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Price. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, other than any Settled Stock Option, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares (each, an 'Adjusted Stock Option'), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (
