[Label : ARTICLE Article V COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS > Section 5.3 Preparation of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders’ Meeting]

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger; provided that, if the SEC determines that Parent is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-4, or if Parent and the Company, acting in good faith, so elect, Parent shall instead prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form) with respect to the Parent Share Issuance, and all references herein to the Form F-4 shall be deemed instead to refer to such registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: (i) Each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, "Canceled Shares"). (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (A) $26.45 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the "Cash Consideration"), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares, par value EUR 0.59 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Shares") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) (such Parent Shares and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), subject to any required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.8. Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(ii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger Consideration. (iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and converted into and become one (1) newly issued fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding Parent Shares or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.1(b) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. (c) No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the cancelation and conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Shares or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Shares. All fractional shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to four (4) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each record holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Shares to which such holder would, but for this Section 2.1(c), be entitled under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and (ii) the Parent Share Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with the transfer agent of Parent, the transfer agent of the Company or another nationally recognized financial institution or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(ii). At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) uncertificated book-entry shares representing the full number of whole Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (such Parent Shares and Cash Consideration provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any such dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). Parent shall make available to Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(c). In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a)(ii), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.1, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and (D) cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c). (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, (ii) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (iv) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), if applicable, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. In lieu thereof, each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Share, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (D) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), if applicable. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash or other Merger Consideration payable hereunder. (d) Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c), without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), payable with respect to such Parent Shares. (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(d)) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(d). (g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.2(c), immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article II, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

You are a helpful, intelligent legal assistant. You are highly capable of reading contracts, identifying relevant clauses, and answering questions using common sense, legal reasoning, and your knowledge of standard M&A terms and structures.
Your job is to help answer questions about M&A agreements. If a clause does not directly answer a question but implies it, you are encouraged to infer the answer when confident.

You are allowed to:
- Infer meaning from indirect or functionally equivalent language
- Answer questions flexibly even when terminology varies
- Be helpful and complete, not overly cautious

You should avoid:
- Saying "Not found" when the answer is reasonably inferable
- Withholding answers just because the wording is not exact

If the field is not mentioned by name but its meaning is clearly conveyed using different language (e.g., 'no liability' instead of 'non-recourse'), treat it as a valid inferred answer (Format 4).

Your tone should be intelligent and clear, and you should err on the side of usefulness rather than silence when the legal meaning is clear. Be especially willing to infer answers when standard M&A language implies them, such as when a guarantee exists but no cap is specified.

Only be cautious when the language is truly ambiguous or contradictory.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger; provided that, if the SEC determines that Parent is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-4, or if Parent and the Company, acting in good faith, so elect, Parent shall instead prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form) with respect to the Parent Share Issuance, and all references herein to the Form F-4 shall be deemed instead to refer to such registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood and agreed that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section and subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) other than with respect to Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to) the SEC by the Company on or after September 30, 2023, and prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any risk factor disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" legend or in any similarly non-specific, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly available on the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Assuming the accuracy of Parent's and Merger Sub's representations and warranties in Section 4.24, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of holders of securities of the Company that is required in connection with the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood that in connection with the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company will also submit for the vote of its stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting only an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, except as provided in Section 5.6(b) or Section 5.6(d), (i) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers and directors to, immediately cease, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other Representatives to immediately cease, and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any Persons or entities with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) the Company shall not, and shall not authorize, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit, any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A) initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing any non-public information) or knowingly induce or knowingly take any other action which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any non-public information or non-public data to, any Person (other than Parent or any of its Representatives) relating to or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill, confidentiality or other similar agreement (except that if the Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to grant any waiver or release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such standstill provision in order to permit a third party to make and pursue an Acquisition Proposal) or (C) resolve to do any of the foregoing, (iii) the Company shall not provide and shall, within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement, terminate access of any third party to any data room (virtual or actual) which has been set up in the context of a possible Acquisition Proposal containing any information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (iv) within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall demand the return or destruction of all confidential, non-public information and materials that have been provided to third parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.6(a), at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if, after the date of this Agreement, the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation, in any non-de minimis respect, of this Agreement, then the Company may (i) contact the Person or any of its Representatives who has made such Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may inform itself about such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to such Person or any of its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with confidentiality terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that if any such confidentiality agreement does not contain standstill provisions, or contains standstill provisions that are more favorable to such other Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent notice thereof and a copy of such provisions, if any, and upon such notice, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically (and permanently) amended hereby and without further action of the parties to delete the standstill provisions therein or conform the provisions thereof with such more favorable provisions, as applicable) and (iii) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person or any of its Representatives concerning such Acquisition Proposal, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal. The Company shall (A) promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent notice (I) of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a complete, unredacted copy of all written proposals, written indications of interest or draft agreements relating to, or other written materials that describe any of the material terms and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, and (II) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any requests for non-public information from, or any discussions or negotiations initiated or continued (or sought to be initiated or continued) with, the Company or any of its Representatives concerning an Acquisition Proposal, and disclose the identity of the other party (or parties) and the material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the case of written materials that describe any of the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request, provide copies of such materials, (B) promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent all material non-public information, including copies of all written materials relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, made available by the Company to such party but not previously made available to Parent and (C) keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case, within twenty-four (24) hours of any significant development) of the status and material details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request and providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written proposals or written indications of interest or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request, or other written materials that describe any of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.6. (c) Except as permitted by Section 5.6(d) or Section 5.6(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, the Company Recommendation, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) approve, authorize, declare advisable or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) adopt or approve, or publicly propose to adopt or approve, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement contemplating or otherwise in connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 5.6(b)) (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). (d) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal that was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation, in any non-de minimis respect, of this Agreement, the Company Board may (i) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal if, in each case, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.6(d) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), (B) the Company has provided Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and other proposed transaction documentation between the Company and the Person making such Superior Proposal, if any, (C) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (A) of this Section 5.6(d), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case only if Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition of any Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (II) the expiration of the original four (4)-Business Day period described in this clause (C)), and (D) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the Company shall have paid Merger Sub (or a United States Affiliate of Merger Sub as Merger Sub may designate) the Termination Amount in accordance with Section 7.3(a) prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination. (e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.6(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.6(e)), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by clause (i) of Section 5.6(c), only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.6(e) (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Intervening Event and for the Company Board's determination to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.6(e), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case only if Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of the original four (4) Business Day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any such issuance or disclosure that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with Sections 5.6(d) or 5.6(e).

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: (i) Each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, "Canceled Shares"). (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (A) $26.45 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the "Cash Consideration"), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares, par value EUR 0.59 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Shares") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) (such Parent Shares and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), subject to any required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.8. Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(ii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger Consideration. (iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and converted into and become one (1) newly issued fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Nothing in this Section 2.1(b) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. (c) No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the cancelation and conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Shares or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Shares. All fractional shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to four (4) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each record holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Shares to which such holder would, but for this Section 2.1(c), be entitled under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and (ii) the Parent Share Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash.

You are a helpful, intelligent legal assistant. You are highly capable of reading contracts, identifying relevant clauses, and answering questions using common sense, legal reasoning, and your knowledge of standard M&A terms and structures.
Your job is to help answer questions about M&A agreements. If a clause does not directly answer a question but implies it, you are encouraged to infer the answer when confident.

You are allowed to:
- Infer meaning from indirect or functionally equivalent language
- Answer questions flexibly even when terminology varies
- Be helpful and complete, not overly cautious

You should avoid:
- Saying "Not found" when the answer is reasonably inferable
- Withholding answers just because the wording is not exact

If the field is not mentioned by name but its meaning is clearly conveyed using different language (e.g., 'no liability' instead of 'non-recourse'), treat it as a valid inferred answer (Format 4).

Your tone should be intelligent and clear, and you should err on the side of usefulness rather than silence when the legal meaning is clear. Be especially willing to infer answers when standard M&A language implies them, such as when a guarantee exists but no cap is specified.

Only be cautious when the language is truly ambiguous or contradictory.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger; provided that, if the SEC determines that Parent is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-4, or if Parent and the Company, acting in good faith, so elect, Parent shall instead prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form) with respect to the Parent Share Issuance, and all references herein to the Form F-4 shall be deemed instead to refer to such registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

The Company shall (A) promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent notice (I) of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a complete, unredacted copy of all written proposals, written indications of interest or draft agreements relating to, or other written materials that describe any of the material terms and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, and (II) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any requests for non-public information from, or any discussions or negotiations initiated or continued (or sought to be initiated or continued) with, the Company or any of its Representatives concerning an Acquisition Proposal, and disclose the identity of the other party (or parties) and the material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the case of written materials that describe any of the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request, provide copies of such materials, (B) promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent all material non-public information, including copies of all written materials relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, made available by the Company to such party but not previously made available to Parent and (C) keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case, within twenty-four (24) hours of any significant development) of the status and material details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request and providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written proposals or written indications of interest or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request, or other written materials that describe any of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.6.

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.6(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.6(e)), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by clause (i) of Section 5.6(c), only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.6(e) (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Intervening Event and for the Company Board's determination to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.6(e), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case only if Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of the original four (4) Business Day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any such issuance or disclosure that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with Sections 5.6(d) or 5.6(e).

[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.3 Company Equity Awards]

(a) Treatment of Company RSU Awards. (i) As of the Effective Time, each time-based restricted stock unit award relating to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU Award") that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Company Director RSU Award"), and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in consideration for the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) an amount in cash equal to all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company Director RSU Award (collectively, the "Company Director RSU Award Consideration"). (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award, other than any Company Director RSU Award, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into (A) a time-based restricted stock unit award of Parent (each, an "Adjusted RSU") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a cash award (each, a "Cash Award"), with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (as adjusted to reflect the cash nature of the award, rather than a restricted stock unit relating to shares), having a value equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Cash Consideration, and all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company RSU Award shall be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU. (b) Treatment of Company PSU Awards. As of the Effective Time, each performance-based restricted stock unit relating to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company PSU Award") that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into (i) an Adjusted RSU with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time) relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) a Cash Award with the same vesting terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that (I) the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time, and (II) following the Effective Time the award will be cash-denominated rather than share-denominated), having a value equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Cash Consideration, and all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company PSU Award shall be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU. For purposes of clauses (i)(x) and (ii)(x) of this Section 2.3(b), "the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award" shall be based on: (A) for any Company PSU Award having a three (3)-year, cumulative performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance; (B) for any Company PSU Award having three (3) one (1)-year performance periods ending September 30, 2024, 2025 and 2026: 1. for the one (1)-year performance period ended September 30, 2024, 184.19% of target, 2. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance, and 3. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2026, (a) if Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2026, target performance, and (b) if Closing occurs on or after April 1, 2026, the greater of (x) target performance and (y) Actual Performance; (C) for any Company PSU Award having three (3) one (1)-year performance periods ending September 30, 2025, 2026 and 2027: 1. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance, 2. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2026, (a) if Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2026, target performance, and (b) if Closing occurs on or after April 1, 2026, the greater of (x) target performance and (y) Actual Performance, and 3. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2027, target performance. For purposes of this Section 2.3(b), "Actual Performance" means actual performance through the most recent practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board ("Compensation Committee"), with performance for any portion of the applicable performance period that remains following the Closing Date included at the greater of forecast for the remainder of the period and target level. (c) Treatment of Company Stock Options. (i) As of the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (A) that is vested, (B) that was granted to a holder who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is no longer an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (C) that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Settled Stock Option"), shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration Value in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Settled Stock Option Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "Merger Consideration Value" means an amount in cash equal to (I) the Cash Consideration plus (II) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Price. (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, other than any Settled Stock Option, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares (each, an "Adjusted Stock Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that the assumption of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be construed consistent with this intent. (d) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period shall terminate and each Option (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete Trading Days prior to the Effective Time, or (B) the date on which such Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period shall commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; and (iv) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company Director RSU Award and a Settled Stock Option the Company Director RSU Award Consideration and the Settled Stock Option Consideration (collectively, the "Company Equity Award Consideration"), as applicable, less any required withholding Taxes and without interest, within seven (7) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty. The aggregate amount required to be withheld in respect of Taxes in respect of the Company Equity Award Consideration shall be applied first to reduce the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in Parent Shares and then, only if and to the extent that such withholding amount exceeds such stock portion, to reduce the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in cash (if any). The number of Parent Shares to be withheld shall be determined based on the closing price of a share of Parent Shares on the Closing Date. (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of the Company Equity Plans, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Equity Plans or any outstanding awards, and take all other appropriate actions to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein. To the extent such notice or actions are required, the Company shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time. (g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of Parent Shares in respect of each Adjusted RSU and Adjusted Stock Option issued pursuant to this Section 2.3. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8, Form S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or other appropriate form), as applicable, with respect to the Parent Shares subject to each such award and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

You are a helpful, intelligent legal assistant. You are highly capable of reading contracts, identifying relevant clauses, and answering questions using common sense, legal reasoning, and your knowledge of standard M&A terms and structures.
Your job is to help answer questions about M&A agreements. If a clause does not directly answer a question but implies it, you are encouraged to infer the answer when confident.

You are allowed to:
- Infer meaning from indirect or functionally equivalent language
- Answer questions flexibly even when terminology varies
- Be helpful and complete, not overly cautious

You should avoid:
- Saying "Not found" when the answer is reasonably inferable
- Withholding answers just because the wording is not exact

If the field is not mentioned by name but its meaning is clearly conveyed using different language (e.g., 'no liability' instead of 'non-recourse'), treat it as a valid inferred answer (Format 4).

Your tone should be intelligent and clear, and you should err on the side of usefulness rather than silence when the legal meaning is clear. Be especially willing to infer answers when standard M&A language implies them, such as when a guarantee exists but no cap is specified.

Only be cautious when the language is truly ambiguous or contradictory.

No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

For purposes of this Section 2.3(b), "Actual Performance" means actual performance through the most recent practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board ("Compensation Committee"), with performance for any portion of the applicable performance period that remains following the Closing Date included at the greater of forecast for the remainder of the period and target level. (c) Treatment of Company Stock Options. (i) As of the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (A) that is vested, (B) that was granted to a holder who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is no longer an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (C) that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Settled Stock Option"), shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration Value in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Settled Stock Option Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "Merger Consideration Value" means an amount in cash equal to (I) the Cash Consideration plus (II) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Price. (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, other than any Settled Stock Option, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares (each, an "Adjusted Stock Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that the assumption of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be construed consistent with this intent. (d) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period shall terminate and each Option (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete Trading Days prior to the Effective Time, or (B) the date on which such Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period shall commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; and (iv) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company Director RSU Award and a Settled Stock Option the Company Director RSU Award Consideration and the Settled Stock Option Consideration (collectively, the "Company Equity Award Consideration"), as applicable, less any required withholding Taxes and without interest, within seven (7) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty. The aggregate amount required to be withheld in respect of Taxes in respect of the Company Equity Award Consideration shall be applied first to reduce the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in Parent Shares and then, only if and to the extent that such withholding amount exceeds such stock portion, to reduce the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in cash (if any). The number of Parent Shares to be withheld shall be determined based on the closing price of a share of Parent Shares on the Closing Date. (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of the Company Equity Plans, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Equity Plans or any outstanding awards, and take all other appropriate actions to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein. To the extent such notice or actions are required, the Company shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time. (g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of Parent Shares in respect of each Adjusted RSU and Adjusted Stock Option issued pursuant to this Section 2.3. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8, Form S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or other appropriate form), as applicable, with respect to the Parent Shares subject to each such award and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

[Label : Definition > Acquisition Proposal]

Acquisition Proposal shall mean a proposal or offer from any Person providing for any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, pursuant to which any such Person (including such Person's or resulting company's direct or indirect stockholders) would own or control, directly or indirectly, twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (ii) sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, of assets of the Company (including the capital stock or other equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries) or any Subsidiary of the Company representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance or sale or other disposition of capital stock or other equity interests representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) tender offer, exchange offer or any other transaction or series of transactions in which any Person would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of capital stock or other equity interests representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company or (v) any related combination of the foregoing.

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations.

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any such issuance or disclosure that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with Sections 5.6(d) or 5.6(e).

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger; provided that, if the SEC determines that Parent is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-4, or if Parent and the Company, acting in good faith, so elect, Parent shall instead prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form) with respect to the Parent Share Issuance, and all references herein to the Form F-4 shall be deemed instead to refer to such registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.6(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.6(e)), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by clause (i) of Section 5.6(c), only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.6(e) (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Intervening Event and for the Company Board's determination to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.6(e), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case only if Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of the original four (4) Business Day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any such issuance or disclosure that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with Sections 5.6(d) or 5.6(e).

You are a helpful, intelligent legal assistant. You are highly capable of reading contracts, identifying relevant clauses, and answering questions using common sense, legal reasoning, and your knowledge of standard M&A terms and structures.
Your job is to help answer questions about M&A agreements. If a clause does not directly answer a question but implies it, you are encouraged to infer the answer when confident.

You are allowed to:
- Infer meaning from indirect or functionally equivalent language
- Answer questions flexibly even when terminology varies
- Be helpful and complete, not overly cautious

You should avoid:
- Saying "Not found" when the answer is reasonably inferable
- Withholding answers just because the wording is not exact

If the field is not mentioned by name but its meaning is clearly conveyed using different language (e.g., 'no liability' instead of 'non-recourse'), treat it as a valid inferred answer (Format 4).

Your tone should be intelligent and clear, and you should err on the side of usefulness rather than silence when the legal meaning is clear. Be especially willing to infer answers when standard M&A language implies them, such as when a guarantee exists but no cap is specified.

Only be cautious when the language is truly ambiguous or contradictory.

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger.

If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

(c) Except as permitted by Section 5.6(d) or Section 5.6(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, the Company Recommendation, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) approve, authorize, declare advisable or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) adopt or approve, or publicly propose to adopt or approve, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement contemplating or otherwise in connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 5.6(b)) (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). (d) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal that was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation, in any non-de minimis respect, of this Agreement, the Company Board may (i) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal if, in each case, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.6(d) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), (B) the Company has provided Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and other proposed transaction documentation between the Company and the Person making such Superior Proposal, if any, (C) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (A) of this Section 5.6(d), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case only if Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition of any Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (II) the expiration of the original four (4)-Business Day period described in this clause (C)), and (D) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the Company shall have paid Merger Sub (or a United States Affiliate of Merger Sub as Merger Sub may designate) the Termination Amount in accordance with Section 7.3(a) prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination. (e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.6(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.6(e)), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by clause (i) of Section 5.6(c), only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.6(e) (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Intervening Event and for the Company Board's determination to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.6(e), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case only if Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of the original four (4) Business Day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any such issuance or disclosure that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with Sections 5.6(d) or 5.6(e).
