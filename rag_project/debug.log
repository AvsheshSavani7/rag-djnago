[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.1 Effect on Securities]

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: (i) Each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, "Canceled Shares"). (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (A) $26.45 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the "Cash Consideration"), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares, par value EUR 0.59 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Shares") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) (such Parent Shares and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), subject to any required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.8. Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(ii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger Consideration. (iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and converted into and become one (1) newly issued fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding Parent Shares or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.1(b) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. (c) No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the cancelation and conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Shares or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Shares. All fractional shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to four (4) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each record holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Shares to which such holder would, but for this Section 2.1(c), be entitled under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and (ii) the Parent Share Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

The Company Board has received the opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Company Common Stock.

The Company shall give notice to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all material discussions with third parties and all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(d) All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has no outstanding options, warrants, rights or any other agreements pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub.

[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates]

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with the transfer agent of Parent, the transfer agent of the Company or another nationally recognized financial institution or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(ii). At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) uncertificated book-entry shares representing the full number of whole Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (such Parent Shares and Cash Consideration provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any such dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). Parent shall make available to Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(c). In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a)(ii), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.1, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and (D) cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c). (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, (ii) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (iv) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), if applicable, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. In lieu thereof, each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Share, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (D) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), if applicable. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash or other Merger Consideration payable hereunder. (d) Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c), without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), payable with respect to such Parent Shares. (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(d)) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(d). (g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.2(c), immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article II, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

Assuming the accuracy of Parent's and Merger Sub's representations and warranties in Section 4.24, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of holders of securities of the Company that is required in connection with the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood that in connection with the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company will also submit for the vote of its stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting only an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

[Label : ARTICLE Article V COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS > Section 5.3 Preparation of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders’ Meeting]

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger; provided that, if the SEC determines that Parent is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-4, or if Parent and the Company, acting in good faith, so elect, Parent shall instead prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form) with respect to the Parent Share Issuance, and all references herein to the Form F-4 shall be deemed instead to refer to such registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.3 Company Equity Awards]

(a) Treatment of Company RSU Awards. (i) As of the Effective Time, each time-based restricted stock unit award relating to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU Award") that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Company Director RSU Award"), and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in consideration for the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) an amount in cash equal to all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company Director RSU Award (collectively, the "Company Director RSU Award Consideration"). (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award, other than any Company Director RSU Award, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into (A) a time-based restricted stock unit award of Parent (each, an "Adjusted RSU") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a cash award (each, a "Cash Award"), with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (as adjusted to reflect the cash nature of the award, rather than a restricted stock unit relating to shares), having a value equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Cash Consideration, and all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company RSU Award shall be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU. (b) Treatment of Company PSU Awards. As of the Effective Time, each performance-based restricted stock unit relating to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company PSU Award") that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into (i) an Adjusted RSU with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time) relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) a Cash Award with the same vesting terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that (I) the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time, and (II) following the Effective Time the award will be cash-denominated rather than share-denominated), having a value equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Cash Consideration, and all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company PSU Award shall be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU. For purposes of clauses (i)(x) and (ii)(x) of this Section 2.3(b), "the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award" shall be based on: (A) for any Company PSU Award having a three (3)-year, cumulative performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance; (B) for any Company PSU Award having three (3) one (1)-year performance periods ending September 30, 2024, 2025 and 2026: 1. for the one (1)-year performance period ended September 30, 2024, 184.19% of target, 2. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance, and 3. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2026, (a) if Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2026, target performance, and (b) if Closing occurs on or after April 1, 2026, the greater of (x) target performance and (y) Actual Performance; (C) for any Company PSU Award having three (3) one (1)-year performance periods ending September 30, 2025, 2026 and 2027: 1. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance, 2. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2026, (a) if Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2026, target performance, and (b) if Closing occurs on or after April 1, 2026, the greater of (x) target performance and (y) Actual Performance, and 3. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2027, target performance. For purposes of this Section 2.3(b), "Actual Performance" means actual performance through the most recent practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board ("Compensation Committee"), with performance for any portion of the applicable performance period that remains following the Closing Date included at the greater of forecast for the remainder of the period and target level. (c) Treatment of Company Stock Options. (i) As of the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (A) that is vested, (B) that was granted to a holder who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is no longer an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (C) that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Settled Stock Option"), shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration Value in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Settled Stock Option Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "Merger Consideration Value" means an amount in cash equal to (I) the Cash Consideration plus (II) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Price. (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, other than any Settled Stock Option, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares (each, an "Adjusted Stock Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that the assumption of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be construed consistent with this intent. (d) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period shall terminate and each Option (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete Trading Days prior to the Effective Time, or (B) the date on which such Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period shall commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; and (iv) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company Director RSU Award and a Settled Stock Option the Company Director RSU Award Consideration and the Settled Stock Option Consideration (collectively, the "Company Equity Award Consideration"), as applicable, less any required withholding Taxes and without interest, within seven (7) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty. The aggregate amount required to be withheld in respect of Taxes in respect of the Company Equity Award Consideration shall be applied first to reduce the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in Parent Shares and then, only if and to the extent that such withholding amount exceeds such stock portion, to reduce the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in cash (if any). The number of Parent Shares to be withheld shall be determined based on the closing price of a share of Parent Shares on the Closing Date. (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of the Company Equity Plans, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Equity Plans or any outstanding awards, and take all other appropriate actions to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein. To the extent such notice or actions are required, the Company shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time. (g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of Parent Shares in respect of each Adjusted RSU and Adjusted Stock Option issued pursuant to this Section 2.3. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8, Form S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or other appropriate form), as applicable, with respect to the Parent Shares subject to each such award and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

Except (i) as disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter (it being understood and agreed that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section and subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) other than with respect to Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3 and Section 4.4, as disclosed in the Parent Public Documents lodged or filed with (or furnished to) the Registrar of Companies (to the extent publicly available), the SEC or ASIC by Parent on or after March 30, 2023, and prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any risk factor disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" legend or in any similarly non-specific, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly available from the Registrar of Companies, EDGAR or on the ASX or ASIC website, Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete fully executed copies of (a) the commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among JH North America Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned indirect Subsidiary of Parent (the "Borrower"), and Bank of America, N.A. and Jeffries Finance LLC (together, the "Initial Lenders") and (b) the fee letters related thereto (as redacted to remove only the fee amounts, pricing caps and the rates and amounts included in the "market flex"), in each case, including all exhibits, term sheets, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letters in effect as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Debt Letters"), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof each of the Initial Lenders party thereto have severally committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to the Borrower (the provision of such funds as set forth therein, but subject to the provisions of Section 5.15(b) (the "Financing")) for the purposes set forth in such Debt Letters. The Debt Letters have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Debt Letters have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement, no such withdrawal, rescission, amendment, restatement or modification is currently contemplated by Parent, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (other than (i) amendments to add additional lenders, arrangers, agents or similar entities or reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between or among, any entities party thereto, (ii) reductions in the commitments as contemplated by the Debt Letters in accordance with the terms thereof, or (iii) amendments to implement or exercise any "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Letters, in each case (i), (ii) and (iii) to the extent not causing any Prohibited Modifications). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against the Borrower and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and subject to general principles of equity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the Debt Letters, including any condition or other contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Letters, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing are as of the date hereof, and together with any other committed financing that replaces or supplements the Financing consistent with the terms set forth in Section 5.15 on the Closing Date will be, sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent's obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses to be incurred in connection therewith. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent, the Borrower, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates under the Debt Letters or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Debt Letters. As of the date of this Agreement there are no side letters or other agreements that impose conditions or contingencies to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or that could otherwise affect the enforceability, availability, termination (without the funding of the commitments thereunder) or amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the conditions to the obligations of Parent to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied, nor does Parent have Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be made available to the Borrower on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt Letters. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder are not subject to any condition regarding Parent's, Merger Sub's or any other Person's ability to obtain financing (including the Financing) for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.1 Effect on Securities]

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: (i) Each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, "Canceled Shares"). (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (A) $26.45 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the "Cash Consideration"), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares, par value EUR 0.59 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Shares") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) (such Parent Shares and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), subject to any required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.8. Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(ii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger Consideration. (iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and converted into and become one (1) newly issued fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding Parent Shares or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.1(b) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. (c) No certificate or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the cancelation and conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Shares or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Shares. All fractional shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to four (4) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each record holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Shares to which such holder would, but for this Section 2.1(c), be entitled under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and (ii) the Parent Share Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates]

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with the transfer agent of Parent, the transfer agent of the Company or another nationally recognized financial institution or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(ii). At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) uncertificated book-entry shares representing the full number of whole Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (such Parent Shares and Cash Consideration provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any such dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). Parent shall make available to Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(c). In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a)(ii), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.1, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and (D) cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c). (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, (ii) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (iv) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), if applicable, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. In lieu thereof, each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Share, (B) the number of Parent Shares (which shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (D) any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), if applicable. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash or other Merger Consideration payable hereunder. (d) Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c), without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), payable with respect to such Parent Shares. (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(d)) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(d). (g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.2(c), immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article II, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his, her or its demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); provided that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give notice to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all material discussions with third parties and all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood and agreed that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section and subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) other than with respect to Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to) the SEC by the Company on or after September 30, 2023, and prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any risk factor disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" legend or in any similarly non-specific, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly available on the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

[Label : ARTICLE Article II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES > Section 2.3 Company Equity Awards]

(a) Treatment of Company RSU Awards. (i) As of the Effective Time, each time-based restricted stock unit award relating to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU Award") that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Company Director RSU Award"), and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in consideration for the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) an amount in cash equal to all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company Director RSU Award (collectively, the "Company Director RSU Award Consideration"). (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award, other than any Company Director RSU Award, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into (A) a time-based restricted stock unit award of Parent (each, an "Adjusted RSU") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a cash award (each, a "Cash Award"), with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (as adjusted to reflect the cash nature of the award, rather than a restricted stock unit relating to shares), having a value equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Cash Consideration, and all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company RSU Award shall be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU. (b) Treatment of Company PSU Awards. As of the Effective Time, each performance-based restricted stock unit relating to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company PSU Award") that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into (i) an Adjusted RSU with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time) relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) a Cash Award with the same vesting terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that (I) the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time, and (II) following the Effective Time the award will be cash-denominated rather than share-denominated), having a value equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Cash Consideration, and all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to each such Company PSU Award shall be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU. For purposes of clauses (i)(x) and (ii)(x) of this Section 2.3(b), "the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award" shall be based on: (A) for any Company PSU Award having a three (3)-year, cumulative performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance; (B) for any Company PSU Award having three (3) one (1)-year performance periods ending September 30, 2024, 2025 and 2026: 1. for the one (1)-year performance period ended September 30, 2024, 184.19% of target, 2. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance, and 3. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2026, (a) if Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2026, target performance, and (b) if Closing occurs on or after April 1, 2026, the greater of (x) target performance and (y) Actual Performance; (C) for any Company PSU Award having three (3) one (1)-year performance periods ending September 30, 2025, 2026 and 2027: 1. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2025, Actual Performance, 2. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2026, (a) if Closing occurs on or prior to March 31, 2026, target performance, and (b) if Closing occurs on or after April 1, 2026, the greater of (x) target performance and (y) Actual Performance, and 3. for the one (1)-year performance period ending September 30, 2027, target performance. For purposes of this Section 2.3(b), "Actual Performance" means actual performance through the most recent practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board ("Compensation Committee"), with performance for any portion of the applicable performance period that remains following the Closing Date included at the greater of forecast for the remainder of the period and target level. (c) Treatment of Company Stock Options. (i) As of the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (A) that is vested, (B) that was granted to a holder who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is no longer an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (C) that was granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a "Settled Stock Option"), shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration Value in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Settled Stock Option Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "Merger Consideration Value" means an amount in cash equal to (I) the Cash Consideration plus (II) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Price. (ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, other than any Settled Stock Option, that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares (each, an "Adjusted Stock Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent Share equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that the assumption of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be construed consistent with this intent. (d) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period shall terminate and each Option (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete Trading Days prior to the Effective Time, or (B) the date on which such Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period shall commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; and (iv) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Company Director RSU Award and a Settled Stock Option the Company Director RSU Award Consideration and the Settled Stock Option Consideration (collectively, the "Company Equity Award Consideration"), as applicable, less any required withholding Taxes and without interest, within seven (7) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty. The aggregate amount required to be withheld in respect of Taxes in respect of the Company Equity Award Consideration shall be applied first to reduce the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in Parent Shares and then, only if and to the extent that such withholding amount exceeds such stock portion, to reduce the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in cash (if any). The number of Parent Shares to be withheld shall be determined based on the closing price of a share of Parent Shares on the Closing Date. (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of the Company Equity Plans, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Equity Plans or any outstanding awards, and take all other appropriate actions to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein.

(d) All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has no outstanding options, warrants, rights or any other agreements pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub.

[Label : ARTICLE Article V COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS > Section 5.3 Preparation of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders’ Meeting]

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parent's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger; provided that, if the SEC determines that Parent is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-4, or if Parent and the Company, acting in good faith, so elect, Parent shall instead prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form) with respect to the Parent Share Issuance, and all references herein to the Form F-4 shall be deemed instead to refer to such registration statement on Form S-4 (or successor form). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Parent Share Issuance") and (C) keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, without limiting Section 5.9, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or such other party's business, financial condition or results of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or the Merger. (b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form F-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, fifty (50) days of the effectiveness of the Form F-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting without Parent's prior written consent; provided, however, that without Parent's prior written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form F-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless agreed to in writing by Parent, any such adjournments or postponements under this clause (ii) shall be for a period of no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to twenty-five (25) Business Days in the aggregate (provided no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders' Meeting). If the Company Board has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.6, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).
